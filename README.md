# Heart_Disease_EDA_Project

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on clinical and behavioral factors influencing heart disease, combining two datasets to identify key patterns and risk indicators.

## Files

- **project.ipynb** – Colab notebook with full EDA workflow and visualizations.  
- **project.pdf** – Presentation highlighting key insights and graphs.
- **heart_df1.csv** – First dataset containing behavioral and clinical factors such as BMI, smoking, physical activity, and general health.    
- **heart_df2.csv** – Second dataset containing additional clinical measurements such as blood pressure, cholesterol, ECG results, and heart disease target labels.

## Key Insights

- Age, cholesterol, blood pressure, and heart rate are major clinical risk factors.  
- BMI, smoking, and physical activity are important behavioral risk factors.  
- Heart disease is more common in older age groups and higher BMI categories.  
- Slightly higher occurrence in males.  
- Combined lifestyle and medical factors help understand heart disease risk.

## Conclusion

Regular health checks, balanced diet, physical activity, and controlled BMI can help reduce heart disease risk. EDA visualizations provide clear insights to guide preventive measures.
