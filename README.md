Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on clinical and behavioral factors influencing heart disease, combining two datasets to identify key patterns and risk indicators.

## Files

- **project.ipynb** – Colab notebook with full EDA workflow and visualizations.  
- **project.pdf** – Presentation highlighting key insights and graphs.

## Key Insights

- Age, cholesterol, blood pressure, and heart rate are major clinical risk factors.  
- BMI, smoking, and physical activity are important behavioral risk factors.  
- Heart disease is more common in older age groups and higher BMI categories.  
- Slightly higher occurrence in males.  
- Combined lifestyle and medical factors help understand heart disease risk.

## Conclusion

Regular health checks, balanced diet, physical activity, and controlled BMI can help reduce heart disease risk. EDA visualizations provide clear insights to guide preventive measures.
